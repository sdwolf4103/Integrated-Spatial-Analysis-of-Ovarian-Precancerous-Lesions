This repository contains the R scripts and analysis code used in the study published at  
**[BioRxiv (2025.06.24.661327v1)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.24.661327v1)**

### `scripts/`
#### `1_STIC_Nanostring_preprocessing.Rmd`
- Converts raw **WTA Nanostring data** into processed count data.  
- **Note:** You do **not** need to run this step if starting from the dataset `GSM9005069`.

#### `2_STIC_Nanostring_NMF.R`
- Performs **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** for molecular subtype classification.  
- The resulting subtype information is stored in the `anno_data` column: Molecular_Subtype

#### `3_STIC_Nanostring_analysis.Rmd`
- Generates all main analyses and figures presented in the publication.  
- Before running, please modify the root path in the script:

- Before running, please modify the path:
  root <- "Location"
  Replace "Location" with your actual project path.

#### R/STIC_Nanostring_Custom_Functions.R
- Contains custom plotting functions used in 3_STIC_Nanostring_analysis.Rmd,
  including the volcano plot function.
